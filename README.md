Project code for Shadow Mirror kinetic interactive art project.

Shadow Mirror is a machine that separates a person from their shadow by scanning it onto a moving piece of glow-in-the-dark fabric, which holds the shadow's image for a short time.

The purpose of this python code is to read a vertical bar of image from a camera and to reproduce the pattern seen in that vertical bar in a strip of WS2811 LEDs, which will transfer the image to the fabric using light.
